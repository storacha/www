# Get Filecoin information for a Piece

To retrieve a [Data Aggregation Proof](/docs/concepts/podsi#data-aggregation-proof) (including [PoDSI](/docs/concepts/podsi)) you can issue a `filecoin/info` invocation to the Storacha service.

## Using the JS client

Piece CIDs are calculated by the client before data is uploaded and are made available in the `onShardStored` callback of `uploadFile`, `uploadDirectory` or `uploadCAR`.

<Callout type="info">
  If you did not store the piece CID when your content was uploaded you can query [content claims](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-storage/content-claims) for an equivalency claim.
</Callout>

Later, you can use the piece CID to retrieve a [Data Aggregation Proof](/docs/concepts/podsi#data-aggregation-proof):

```js
const result = await client.capability.filecoin.info(piece)
```

The result contains aggregate piece CIDs and inclusion proofs (PoDSI):

```js
for (const { aggregate, inclusion } of result.ok.aggregates) {
  console.log(`Aggregate CID: ${aggregate}`)
  console.log(`Inclusion Proof: ${inclusion}`)
}
```

Inclusion proofs can be verified using the `@web3-storage/data-segment` library:

```js
import { Proof, Piece } from '@web3-storage/data-segment'

const result = Proof.verify(inclusion.subtree, {
  tree: Piece.fromLink(aggregate).root,
  node: Piece.fromLink(piece).root
})
```

The result also contains details of storage providers and deals the aggregate appears in:

```js
for (const { provider, aux } of result.ok.deals) {
  console.log(`Storage Provider: f0${provider}`)
  console.log(`Deal ID: ${aux.dataSource.dealID}`)
}
```

## Using the CLI

Piece CIDs are calculated by the client before data is uploaded and will be printed to the terminal if you pass the `--verbose` option to `w3 up`.

<Callout type="info">
  If you did not store the piece CID when your content was uploaded you can query [content claims](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-storage/content-claims) for an equivalency claim.
</Callout>

Later, you can use the piece CID to print out [Data Aggregation Proof](/docs/concepts/podsi#data-aggregation-proof) information:

```sh
$ w3 can filecoin info bafkzcibe52kq2dtip2bmrrw5qhphsa35onsxxvkuxl33dnotq2allfpz7tdxlhc5di
