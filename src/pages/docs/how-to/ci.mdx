# How to upload from CI

> Publish files to IPFS and Filecoin via Storacha from a Continuous Integration server.

Using `w3cli` locally, the steps are

- [Create a space](#create-a-space) that you want CI to upload to _(or use an existing one)_
- [Create a signing key](#create-a-signing-key) for CI to use with `w3 key create`
- [Create a proof](#create-a-proof) that delegates capabilities to upload to your space to that key

Then in the CI environment

- [Install `w3cli` from npm](#install-w3cli-in-ci)
- [Import the signing key](#import-the-signing-key) by setting it as `W3_PRINCIPAL` in the env
- [Import the proof](#import-the-proof) by passing it to `w3 space add`
- [Upload your files](#upload-your-files) with `w3 up`

## Example

Using `w3cli` locally create a signing key and a proof.

```shell
# Create key and did. Use the output `key` value as W3_PRINCIPAL in CI.
$ w3 key create --json > ci-key.json

# Extract the did as $AUDIENCE
$ AUDIENCE=$(jq -r .did ci-key.json)

# Create a signed proof that you delegate capabilties to that key. 
$ w3 delegation create $AUDIENCE -c space/blob/add -c space/index/add -c filecoin/offer -c upload/add --base64
mAYIEAP8OEaJlcm9vdHOAZ3ZlcnNpb24BwwUBcRIg+oHTbzShh1WzBo9ISkonCW+KAcy/+zW8Zb...

# Pass the output to `w3 space add` in ci
```

Then on the CI side (in [github flavour](https://github.com/web3-storage/add-to-web3/blob/abc09576bd0f06e881b250012cc94c535b2d577f/action.yml#L42-L54))

```yaml
steps:
  - run: npm install -g @web3-storage/w3cli

  - run: w3 space add ${{ inputs.proof }}
    env:
      W3_PRINCIPAL: ${{ inputs.secret_key }}

  - run: w3 up ${{ inputs.path_to_add }}
    env:
      W3_PRINCIPAL: ${{ inputs.secret_key }}
```

The rest of this document explains the process in more detail.

## Create a space

On your local machine with [w3cli][] installed and logged in (see: https://storacha.network/docs/quickstart/) run

```shell
$ w3 space create
```

and follow the instructions. (See: https://storacha.network/docs/how-to/create-space/#using-the-cli if you get stuck.)

If you want to use an existing space, make sure it is set as your current space using `w3 space ls` and `w3 space use`

## Create a signing key

On your local machine, use [w3cli][] to generate a new a new Ed25519 private signing key for CI to use.

```shell
# Use the `did` in the input to the next command. 
# Use `key` as your `secret_key` for add_to_web3.
$ w3 key create --json
{
  "did": "did:key:z6Mk...",
  "key": "MgCaT7Se2QX9..."
}
```

Keep the `key` safe. It will be used by CI to sign requests to Storacha.

The `did` from the command above is the public decentalised identifier for that private `key`.

## Create a proof

On your local machine, use [w3cli][] to delegate capabilties to upload to our space to the public DID for the signing key we created.

Our CI environment doesn't need to list our uploads or change our billing plan so we only delegate the `space/blob/add`, `space/index/add`, `filecoin/offer` and `upload/add` capabilities to it.

Pass the `did` for the signing key as the audience parameter. We are delegating capabilities to that key.

```shell
$ AUDIENCE=did:key:z6Mk...

# Delegate capabilities to the `did` we created above.
$ w3 delegation create $AUDIENCE -c space/blob/add -c space/index/add -c filecoin/offer -c upload/add --base64
mAYIEAP8OEaJlcm9vdHOAZ3ZlcnNpb24BwwUBcRIg+oHTbzShh1WzBo9ISkonCW+KAcy/+zW8Zb...
```

The output is a base64 encoded UCAN proof, signed by your local key. It can only be used as proof by the signing key we specified by the DID we passed in.

Now we have a signing key and a proof we can use in the CI environment.

## Install `w3cli` in CI

Install it from npm with the --global flag to make the `w3` command available.

```shell
$ npm i --global @web3-storage/w3cli
```

## Import the signing key

Set `W3_PRINCIPAL=<the signing key>` in the CI environment. The `w3` commmand will use the value as the signing key to use. see: https://github.com/web3-storage/w3cli?tab=readme-ov-file#w3\_principal

The value is the `key` we created above with `w3 key create`. The `key` must be the one for the `did` that was used to create the proof.

## Import the proof

Set `W3_PROOF=<the proof>` in the CI environment.

In your CI job definition, run the `w3 space add` command to import the proof that it can upload to the space we created.

```shell
$ w3 space add $W3_PROOF
```

## Upload your files

In your CI job definition, run the `w3 up` command to upload the files you want to publish on IPFS and store in Filecoin.

```shell
$ w3 up <path to files>
```

that path might be the `dist` or `output` directory of a previous step that built your static website or collected some stats from a job.

Once that command returns succesfully, you are done, your files are content addressed and available over IPFS.

If you want to capture the CID for your uploads pass the `--json` flag and use `jq` to extract it

```shell
# write the output as json to a file
$ w3 up <path to files> --json > ./w3_up_output.json

# extract the root cid from the output and set it as an env var.
$ CID=$(jq --raw-output '.root."/"' ./w3_up_output.json)
```

## Github Action: add-to-web3

The [add-to-web3][] action is a lightweight wrapper around [w3cli][]. You create the key and proof as before, and the action configures and runs `w3` in CI for you.

Use it in your Github Workflow like this

```yaml
uses: web3-storage/add-to-web3@v3
id: w3up
with:
  path_to_add: 'dist'
  secret_key: ${{ secrets.W3_PRINCIPAL }}
  proof: ${{ secrets.W3_PROOF }}

# use the outputs in subsequent steps
# "bafkreicysg23kiwv34eg2d7qweipxwosdo2py4ldv42nbauguluen5v6am"
- run: echo ${{ steps.w3up.outputs.cid }}

# "https://bafkreicysg23kiwv34eg2d7qweipxwosdo2py4ldv42nbauguluen5v6am.ipfs.w3s.link"
- run: echo ${{ steps.w3up.outputs.url }}
```

It uploads `path_to_add` to Storacha.

It outputs the root CID as `cid` and IPFS Gateway URL as `url` for subsequent steps in your workflow to use.

We use the action to publish _this website_ (üëÅÔ∏è‚ÅÇüëÅÔ∏è) to IPFS when a PR is merged to `main`. We use the `cid` output from the action as input to [update a dns record](https://github.com/web3-storage/www/blob/18044a3814846967fca1126ab3baa3973c43e908/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L79-L89) called a [DNSlink][] for the domain.

Setting the [DNSLink][] announces the new root CID for the website, so [IPFS-aware browsers](https://brave.com/ipfs-support/) and [IPFS Companion](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-companion/) can load the site over IPFS.
