# Welcome to Storacha Documentation! 
(previously: web3.storage)

## Hey there, Storage Superstar!
Welcome to the hottest storage solution in the web3 universe! You’ve landed at Storacha Network, the dazzling revitalization of Web3.Storage. We're here to keep your data safe, sound, and supercharged with the power of decentralization.

## New Name, Same Rock-Solid Service
We might have a new name, but we’re still delivering the same rock-solid decentralized hot storage you know and love. Storacha Network is all about spicing up your storage game, with the same reliability and innovation that got us here.

**Under the hood** Storacha uses [UCANs](https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec) for trustless, local-first authorization, and is backed by the provable storage of [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/what-is-filecoin). Our goal is to enhance Filecoin with a scalable hot storage solution while also ensuring the data is retrievable via [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) 

When it comes down to building your next application, service, or website, Storacha keeps it simple. You get all the benefits of decentralized storage technologies with the frictionless experience you expect in a modern dev workflow. **All you need to use Storacha is a key-pair and your data.**
