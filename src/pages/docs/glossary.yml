- id: agent
  name: Agent
  definition: A software component that manages signing keys and delegations needed to invoke w3up APIs.
  details: |
    Agents are used to invoke capabilities provided by the w3up service layer, using the [ucanto](https://github.com/web3-storage/ucanto) RPC framework. 
    
    Agents are created locally on an end-user's device, and users are encouraged to create new agents for each device (or browser) that they want to use, rather than sharing agent keys between devices.

- id: audience
  name: Audience
  definition: The intended recipient of a UCAN token, identified by DID
  details: |
    Each UCAN token is "addressed to" a specific principal, known as the audience.
    
    When invoking a capability, the service provider is the audience of the invocation.
   
    When delegating permissions, the audience is the party receiving the delegation.

- id: bitswap
  definition: A peer-to-peer protocol used by IPFS and Filecoin to distribute blocks of data throughout the network.
  details: |
    While the w3up APIs do not use Bitswap directly, once data is stored with web3.storage it is made available via Bitswap to the larger IPFS network.

- id: block
  definition: A chunk of binary data that can be identified by CID.
  details: |
    Data stored with web3.storage is encoded into blocks, with large files consisting of several blocks linked together.

    Blocks can be uniquely identified by <Term id="cid">CID (Content Identifier)</Term>, and are often bundled into Content Archives (CARs) for transport and storage.

- id: car
  name: CAR
  definition: A collection of blocks, packaged for storage and transport.
  details: |
    CARs are like a [tar file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) for content-addressed data. 
    
    Used extensively by w3up protocols, although most users shoudn't be exposed to them directly for the most common operations.

- id: cid
  name: CID
  definition: A Content Identifier that uniquely and verifiably identifies a block of data.
  details: |
    A CID consists of a cryptographic hash of the data it identifies, as well as a few bytes of metadata indicating what format the content is expected to be in. 
    
    See [the IPFS docs](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) for more details.

- id: dag
  name: DAG
  definition: A Directed Acyclic Graph data structure.
  details: |
    A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a data structure that represents a collection of linked objects ("nodes"), 
    where the links between nodes ("edges") have certain properties. 
    For example, you can't have "cycles" or loops in the graph, where following a set of edges brings you back to the node you started from.

    IPFS encodes files and directories into DAGs comprised of <Term id="block">blocks</Term> of data,
    where each block can optionally link to other blocks using its <Term id="cid">CID</Term>.

    Most DAGs will have a single "root" node which represents the "top" of the graph. 
    By starting at the root node and traversing the links, you can find all the blocks that make up the DAG.

- id: did
  name: DID
  definition: A decentralized identifier that contains or links to a cryptographic public key.
  details: |
    DIDs are decentralized identifiers that don't rely on any single authority to issue and validate.

    See our [DID intro article](/concepts/dids/) for more details.

- id: dht
  name: DHT
  definition: A Distributed Hash Table allows many peers in a peer-to-peer network to locate each other and coordinate to provide services.
  details: |
    IPFS uses a DHT to advertise content to the network, making it discoverable to all peers who query the DHT.
    The DHT does not contain the full content - instead a small "provider record" contains addresses of peers 
    who will serve the content on request (e.g. via <Term id="bitswap">Bitswap</Term>).
    
    Content stored with web3.storage is discoverable via the public IPFS DHT.

- id: elastic-ipfs
  name: Elastic IPFS
  definition: A "cloud-native" IPFS implementation developed by Protocol Labs.
  details: |
    Elastic IPFS is an implementation of IPFS designed to leverage cloud storage for scalability and efficient retrieval.

    Content is stored on commodity cloud storage (e.g. Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2) in <Term id="car">CAR</Term> format,
    along with indexes that allow efficient location and retrieval of data within the CARs.
    
    Elastic IPFS interoperates with the public IPFS network by making content available via <Term id="bitswap">Bitswap</Term>.

- id: gateway
  name: Gateway
  definition: An IPFS gateway allows retrieving IPFS content via HTTP, allowing any web browser to access data stored with IPFS.
  details: |
    Gateways act as a "bridge" between IPFS's peer-to-peer protocols and the HTTP protocol used by web browsers.

    You can fetch IPFS content from a gateway by creating a gateway URL from the <Term id="cid">CID</Term> of your content,

    To use the web3.storage gateway at `w3s.link`, make a URL like this, replacing `${cid}` with the CID you want to link to:

    ```
    https://${cid}.ipfs.w3s.link
    ```

- id: ipfs
  name: IPFS
  definition: The InterPlanetary File System, a distributed system for sharing and linking to content-addressed data.
  details: |
    IPFS is a system for organizing, locating, and transmitting data using cryptographic hashes to identify each piece of content.
    There are many IPFS implementations, which work together to form a public network
    (as well as specialized private networks).
    web3.storage makes all uploaded content available to the IPFS network
    via <Term id="bitswap">Bitswap</Term>, as well as via HTTP through <Term id="gateway">gateways</Term>.

- id: ipld
  name: IPLD
  definition: InterPlanetary Linked Data is a collection of data formats that can be linked together by CID.
  details: |
    IPLD is a specification for data types that can be linked together by <Term id="cid">CID</Term> to form a <Term id="dag">DAG</Term>.

    <Term id="unixfs">UnixFS</Term> is an IPLD data format, but IPLD also supports
    JSON, CBOR, and other encodings for structured data that do not need the "file-like"
    metadata included in UnixFS.

    See the [IPLD website](https://ipld.io) for more information.

- id: issuer
  name: Issuer
  definition: The creator and signer of a UCAN token, identified by DID.
  details: |
    Each UCAN token must be signed by the private key belonging to the issuer.
   
    When invoking a capability, the issuer is the agent executing the invocation.
   
    When delegating permissions, the issuer is the agent who currently possesses 
    the given permissions and is delegating them to another agent (the audience).

- id: space
  definition: A unique identifier that acts as a "namespace" for uploaded content.
  details: |
    The w3up APIs use "spaces" to group uploads together, similar to how cloud storage buckets group stored objects.

    Spaces act as the "destination" for uploaded data, and permissions to write to and/or manage a space can be delegated
    to multiple <Term id="agent">agents</Term>.

- id: ucan
  name: UCAN
  definition: User Controlled Authorization Networks are an authentication and authorization protocol designed for decentralized systems.
  details: |
    The w3up APIs use UCAN extensively to provide services and authorize invocations.

    See our [intro to UCAN article](/concepts/ucan/) for an overview.

- id: ucanto
  name: ucanto
  definition: A remote procedure call (RPC) framework based on UCANs.
  details: |
    The <Term id="ucan">UCAN</Term>-based w3up APIs are implemented using the [ucanto framework](https://github.com/web3.storage/ucanto).
    
    ucanto provides the "plumbing" for type-safe UCAN-based APIs, allowing services to define capability handlers which can be invoked by authorized clients.

- id: unixfs
  name: UnixFS
  definition: A data format used by IPFS to represent files and directories.
  details: |
    UnixFS is a data format used by <Term id="ipfs">IPFS</Term> to encode files and directories into a <Term id="dag">DAG</Term> structure.
    When preparing data for IPFS, the UnixFS encoder will chunk files into <Term id="block">blocks</Term> that are linked by <Term id="cid">CID</Term>. 

    UnixFS is used by IPFS on all operating systems, including Windows.
    The name indicates that the format supports some common metadata used on Unix platforms,
    for example, symbolic links and modification time.

- id: w3up
  name: w3up
  definition: The name of web3.storage's UCAN-based storage platform.
  details: |
    When web3.storage first launched, it offered a traditional "RESTful" / "JSON over HTTP" API,
    aimed at getting traditional web developers tapped into the potential of decentralized,
    content addressed storage.

    After learning a lot from our first iteration, we created a new API backed
    by <Term id="elastic-ipfs">Elastic IPFS</Term> that leverages <Term id="ucan">UCANs</Term> 
    to provide secure and flexible authorization that can integrate with traditional web apps
    as well as fully decentralized smart contract applications.

    The new APIs are provided by a collection of <Term id="ucanto">ucanto</Term> services and are
    collectively known as "w3up" to distinguish them from our "v1" RESTful API.

    You can learn more about the motivations for w3up in our [beta announcement blog post](https://blog.web3.storage/posts/w3up-beta-launch).
