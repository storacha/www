# Terms of service
<!-- 
\[If you are still using the legacy Storacha API (e.g., you created an account before November 14, 2023), please view the applicable Terms of Service [here](https://old.storacha/terms/).] -->

The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Storacha website (“Storacha” or the “Website”), the w3link/w3s.link gateway (“Gateway”) and all content, services and products available at or through the Website or Gateway (collectively, “Services”). The Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein. As all data uploaded to storacha will be available via IPFS, the Services are also subject to the [Terms of Service of IPFS.io](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/tos) and [Privacy Policy of IPFS.io](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/privacy).

If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement (“Agreement” or “TOS”), then you may not access the Website or use any of the Services.

Nitro Data LLC (“we,” “us”) may make changes to this Agreement and pricing from time to time. If you do not agree to these revisions, you may stop using the Services.

## Storage term

Data stored via the Services will be available via IPFS and stored on Filecoin until the expiry of the respective deals. There may be a delay between content being uploaded via the Services and being stored on Filecoin through a deal. Additionally, you may experience minor delays immediately after uploading new content to the Services while this content becomes available on the IPFS network.

The maximum size of a registered upload is 750GB. Uploads greater than this size may not be registered successfully with your account, though if the data is successfully stored with Storacha, you will still be responsible for paying for this storage.

We reserve the right to terminate the Services at our sole discretion or to transfer operation of the Services to a third party or smart contract. Prior to termination or transfer, we will provide 90 days’ notice to users via email to allow users enough time to make arrangements if any (e.g. remote pinning to their own IPFS node, remote pinning to another service, or preparing to manage the renewal of their Filecoin deals on their own).

All data uploaded to Storacha is available to anyone who requests it using the correct CID. **Users should not store any private or sensitive information in an unencrypted form using Storacha.** Deleting files from Storacha via the site's web console or API will remove them from the file listing for a user's account, but you may be charged for at least 30 days of storage for those files. Additionally, uploaded files typically remain on our infrastructure for at minimum thirty (30) days, and nodes on the IPFS network may retain copies of the data indefinitely. **Users should not use Storacha to store data that may need to be permanently deleted in the future.**

## Paid Accounts

### Billing

In order to begin storing files via the Services, you will need to provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid method of payment, which may involve a third party or payment processing vendor. You can increase your storage limit and add paid features to your account by signing up for a paid subscription plan (“Paid Plan”).

You agree that you’ll pay the amounts set forth in https://storacha.network/pricing/ for your chosen tier (“Subscription Charge”) plus any charges for additional usage beyond the storage limit of your selected tier during the previous month (“Overages”) (collectively, “Subscription Charge” and “Overages” are referred to as (the “Fees”) for each billing cycle).

When determining tier storage limits and Overages, we track usage for payment using the volume of data associated with shard content identifiers/CIDs (CIDs referencing the actual data sent to Storacha and stored) – usage is not tracked based on content CIDs (CIDs used to reference and access uploads in a format useful to users, like specific files and directories).

You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of Fees you owe us. You remain responsible for any uncollected Fees. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the Paid Plan until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you additional fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.

### Cancellation

You can cancel your Paid Plan at any time, and you will be able to upload new Data to Storacha through the end of your billing period. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used membership periods. After cancellation, data uploaded via a Paid Plan may not be available through our hosted IPFS infrastructure after the end of your billing period.

### Plan Adjustments

You may change your chosen tier at any point. You will be charged for the tier you’re subscribed to at the time of billing (plus any Overages for stored content over that tier’s limit). By selecting your tier, you consent to the limits associated with your chosen tier (as set forth in https://storacha.network/pricing/); you also consent to the Overages described in this Agreement.

### Changes

We reserve the right to change our Paid Plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time, in our sole discretion and without notice. If we adjust the pricing of your Paid Plan, we will provide you with at least fourteen (14) days’ notice before these changes take effect. By continuing to use the Services, you agree to terms of this Agreement (including any updated terms).

### Taxes

The Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes assessable by any domestic or foreign jurisdiction (“Taxes”). You agree that you’re responsible for any applicable Taxes, and that you will provide us with any applicable tax identification information that we may require by law to ensure our compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions.

### Overages

You agree to pay the following Overages fees for storage amounts exceeding your selected tier (for more information on tiers, see https://storacha.network/pricing/). Overages will be billed to you at the beginning of your next billing cycle.
